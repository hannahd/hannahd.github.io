  <h2>Speaker & Writer</h2>
  <p>Teaching helps bring clarity to my process and philosophy. I love to build up others, especially acting as a mentor to young women and other underrepresented groups that are interested in the creative side of building technology.</p>
  <h3>Crafting Product Vision Stories <small>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BppRcVXSjZM">Recording</a>)</small></h3>
  <p>If you have ever gotten blank stares when describing what you know is the perfect solution, this workshop is for you! Storytelling has been gaining increasing attention as a powerful tool for persuasion and collaboration. Building up a story around your ideas, big or small, helps people understand the problem, empathize with users, and visualize the impact of your solution. In this workshop you'll apply the standard three act storytelling framework to an idea you are working on and walk away with a supercharged way to share your vision.</p>

  <h3>Beyond High or Low: Multi-Fidelity Rapid Prototyping <small>(<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/HannahDeering1/beyond-high-or-low-multifidelity-rapid-prototyping-university-of-illinois-webcon">Slides</a>)</small></h3>
  <p>Rapid prototyping is a way to cheaply build and test ideas. Faster prototypes mean more ideas, more feedback cycles, and more iterations. It lets you get ideas out into the real world where they can be measured and tested. By becoming far more intentional with the way you approach planning your prototypes, you can become far more rapid when it's time to build. Expand beyond just high- or low-fidelity to discover a host of options to better tune your prototype to your goals.

  <h3>Product Visiontyping <small>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BppRcVXSjZM">Recording</a>)</small></h3>
  <p> Do you have big dreams for your product that are always getting passed up for incremental changes? This talk will show you how to turn those dreams into tangible visiontypes that can inspire your team and persuade stakeholders.</p>

  <h3>Build It Better: How To Make Technology People Love <small>(<a href="https://www.slideshare.net/HannahDeering1/build-it-better-how-to-make-technology-people-love">Slides</a>)</small></h3>
  <p>  An introduction for Middle Schoolers to the build, measure, learn cycle of creating technology for people. To put these ideas into practice, teams would work together to craft a prototype purse out of various materials for a particular user.

  <p>I love podcasts. In 2019, I’m breaking out of my bubble of go-tos and challenging myself to try two new podcasts per week.</p>

  <p>I draw sketchnotes to help retain and share insights from things I read, hear, and watch. A picture is worth a thousand words.</p>
