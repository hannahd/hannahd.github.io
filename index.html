  <h2>UX Design Leader</h2>
  <p>I am the Principal UX Designer for Workiva’s Global Statutory Reporting solution. Workiva empowers accounting and finance teams to collaborate on buisness-critical data and reports. Previously, I lead an incredible team of designers and researchers in crafting the Workiva's Document Platform (including the Document, Spreadsheets, and Presentations products).</p>
  <p>I am also a part of Workiva’s UX Leadership & Operations group. Workiva is an incredibly large and complex application with a growing number of designers. This group designs team processes to promote collaboration, consistency, and efficiency. I have lead efforts to improve our twice weekly design critiques and establish clear expectations around performance and promotions.</p>

  <h2>Other Projects</h2>
  <h3><a href="https://hannahd.github.io/100podcasts/">100 Podcast Challenge</a></h3>
  <p>I love podcasts. In 2019, I’m breaking out of my bubble of go-tos and challenging myself to try two new podcasts per week.</p>
  <h3><a href="https://twitter.com/i/moments/1098327234014793728">Sketchnotes</a></h3>
  <p>I draw sketchnotes to help retain and share insights from things I read, hear, and watch. A picture is worth a thousand words.</p>
  <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChEXLDTYF2yejbZ1RwtMq-A">Video Tutorials</a></h3>
  <p>I get a lot out of YouTube’s tutorial community. I’ve added my own videos to share what I’ve learned in an approachable way.</p>
  <h3><a href="https://hannahd.github.io/assets/2013HannahDeeringMSThesis.pdf">Web Autism Accessibility Study</a></h3>
  <p>In my Masters’ Thesis, I conducted a pilot eye-tracking study to quantify web content evaluation in students with Autism.</p>
