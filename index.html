    <h2>Philosophy</h2>

        <div class="col-6">
            <h3>1/ People first.</h3>
            <p>Real, messy, beautiful, complex people make and use products. Building deep relationships with both the individuals who create the software, and the individuals who use the software is critical to success. Your users are not personas; your
                developers are not&nbsp;stereotypes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
            <h3>2/ UX > UI.</h3>
            <p>User Experience decisions extend far deeper than the pixels on the screen. It is in the way your product gets packaged and sold. It is in the architectural decisions that determine what is possible. It is in the recruitment of a great team.
                UX needs a seat at every one of those&nbsp;tables.</p>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
            <h3>3/ Focus on the problem.</h3>
            <p>Discover the core problem. Get stakeholders agree on that problem. Gather data around the problem. Focus ideas and feedback on solving that core problem. Solution-focus leads to wasted time and bruised egos. The market is full of neat ideas
                that failed because that weren’t rooted in a&nbsp;probem.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
            <h3>4/ Bias towards action.</h3>
            <p>When working with highly intelligent critical thinkers, it is far too easy to get into a state of analysis paralysis. Assumed risks and unknowns block progress. Acting forces secret assumptions into the open. Mistakes will be made, but failing
                fast reduces time wasted on bad&nbsp;ideas.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
            <h3>5/ Make ideas tangible.</h3>
            <p>This is the designer’s main role. Sketches, whiteboarding, mockups and prototypes are all tools to pull ideas from the blurry imaginationland into reality. These concrete artifacts ensure teams are actually on the same page. People also don’t
                know what they’ll like until they see and try&nbsp;it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
            <h3>6/ All things in context.</h3>
            <p>People don’t work in controlled labs. Design for the real world context, not just the happy path. Stress, distractions and time pressures are almost impossible to simulate. This means visiting users onsite, empathizing with their broader story,
                using real data instead of lorem ipsum, and testing in the&nbsp;wild.</p>

    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
            <p>I am currently a Senior UX Designer at Workiva, transforming the way that accounting and finance teams work together. I have experiences ranging from contracting with early startups to interning at GE's Software Center of Excellence. I hold
                degrees in Design, Computer Science and Human-Computer Interaction from Iowa State University. My Master’s thesis explored web accessibility for students with Autism Spectrum Disorders. I am passionate about promoting women in technology
                through training and outreach programs, exposing young women to the creative and empowering side of building&nbsp;technology.</p>

            <h3>Not your average designer</h3>
            <p><em>I speak dev.</em> This goes beyond a base understanding of HTML &amp; CSS. With my Computer Science degree, I can have deeper discussions with developers about constraints and opportunities of the technology focusing on impacts to the
                User Experience. I’m comfortable having discussions about topics like linear vs logorithmic runtime, causal vs eventual consistency, and the benefits client vs server&nbsp;execution.</p>
            <p><em>I evangelize good ideas.</em> Big ideas require a lot of people to get behind them in order to come to life. I have more than 3 years of experience building a vision, addressing concerns, influencing stakeholders, and driving concepts
                and process improvements&nbsp;forward.</p>
            <p><em>I’m a wicked fast prototyper.</em> I have found quickly building prototypes as the most effective way to advance quality design, so I have worked hard to build this skill. I’ve given <a href="">multiple talks <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> on the subject at meetups and&nbsp;conferences.</p>
