Much [has been said][1] of [the merits][2] of being a “[lifelong learner][3],” especially in a world as rapidly evolving as technology. The phrase itself conveys images of gentle silver-haired retirees easing themselves behind wooden desks to drink up esoteric knowledge in field they always longed to pursue. The scenes in our minds eye are serene, beautiful, enlightened. The truth is rarely so pristine.

> Learning is ugly.

Building a skill or comprehending truly novel knowledge is is a bumpy and difficult chore. Most of us have the luxury of sitting years or even decades from the last time we were actually a complete beginner, or n00b, at anything.

Children on the other hand are complete beginners at just about everything. As I was digging through old boxes of my childhood projects and trinkets, I was struck by the variety of activities I explored. We accept and encourage the novice outputs of kids, exalting drawings like the one below to refrigerator galleries.

But what if I told you that drawing was done by a 30 year old? You might laugh, but why? What if she had just as much experience drawing as a four year old? As we get older, society’s acceptance of our stumbling novice attempts at new skills diminishes significantly. It becomes something to mock rather than nourish, eroding confidence just as it buds.

Is it any wonder, then, that most people rigidly stick with what they know, what they’re already good at, what they can boast about and feel a sense of satisfaction and pride in?

In order to build a community of lifelong learners, two things must happen:

1. Learners must be brave. We need to feel comfortable in the discomfort of being bad at something new. 
2. The community should be encouraging. Honest critique should focus on achievable goals and be cautious of shutting down curiosity.

If we harass people away from being beginners, they will never become experts. Their amazing voices, ideas, and innovations won’t ever see the light of day, and we will all be worse off. So, please — be nice to the n00bs.
