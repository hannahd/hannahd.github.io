With 36% of all the Internetâ€™s worldwide users<sup>[1][1]</sup>, and an average of 340 million Tweets sent per day (as of March 2012)<sup>[2][2]</sup>, Twitter can safely be called a noisy place. The Twitter firehose (a term used in their documentation<sup>[3][3]</sup>) inundates users with a constant stream of the latest Tweets from the people they follow. Buried in this stream could be important announcements from friends, breaking current events, and relevant, interesting articles. The lists feature, introduced in 2009, helps sort the flow a little, however, the problem remains that the prolific Tweeters obscure the more reserved, and the mundane often drown out the profound.

This webapp experiments in cutting through the noise of Twitter and emphasizing the lesser heard voices, important events, and worthwhile links.
